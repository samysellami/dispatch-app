# A django based Dispatch Application

An application that listens for requests, and, on receiving a notification, re-dispatches it to multiple targets based on the input provided.
The possible targets are email and phone number.

The notifications are also stored in a database to keep track of what is being sent.

## 1. Main features

The application has a frontend and a backend.

The **frontend** was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It creates an interface containing the form that enables the user to send a notification.

The **backend** is based on [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/).
It uses models and views to serialize and process the data, send notifications to the specified targets, and sends a success/failure response to the frontend.

To send SMS, **Twilio** API was used. Unfortunately, _the free version does not allow to send SMS to non verified phone numbers_.,
(the only verified phone number is the owner number: +79600603696)

## 2. Testing the application

```
python manage.py test
